            <h1>Guide to Space Arena Ship Designer</h1>
            Welcome to the guide to <a href="./" target="_blank">Space Arena Ship Designer</a>.
            <br/>
            Space Arena Ship Designer is an editor to create ship layouts for the game
            <a href="https://space-arena.com/" target="_blank">Space Arena</a>.<br/>
            When a design is finished, it can be submitted on either
            <a class="link" href="https://discord.gg/spacearena" target="_blank">Discord</a> or
            <a class="link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceArenaOfficial" target="_blank">Reddit</a>
            for the developers to consider adding to the game.<br/>
            If you know that the editor exists, you most likely already know what ships in the game look like. However,
            I have
            provided two examples just in case.

            If you would like a tutorial on making art for ships,
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/106KDS3sPDD05ZVTYLQoD_S8LGIdp_Tkg8TcKc_9XuNE/edit?usp=drivesdk">
                here's a link to EnderRobo's ship art tutorial (Google Doc)</a>.
        </div>
        <div id="cells">
            <br /><br />
            The first part of the editor is the grid. This is where you draw your design.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733165735207108626/Screenshot_62.png"
                 alt="Image of grid">
            You have probably discovered that you can click or tap on this grid to fill in cells with gray.<br/>
            Gray cells are regular, basic cells. You can change what type of cell you are drawing with either by
            scrolling, or by using the cell selection menu in the upper right corner.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733166924401475655/Screenshot_63.png"
                 alt="Image of cell selection menu">
            There are 12 cell types to select from, as well as the empty cell. The cell selection menu will tell you
            what kind of cell is currently selected.
        </div>
        <div id="modes">
            There are four cell fill modes. The default mode is single select, which allows you to fill in one cell at a time.<br/>
            You can also click and drag to draw lines of cells, though this doesn't work well on mobile.<br/><br/>
            You can change what type of fill mode you want to use by clicking one of the four mode icons.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733168018351456286/Screenshot_64.png"
                 alt="Image of fill mode icons">
            In addition to single select, you have options for<br/>
            <ul>
                <li>Rectangle select: Allows you to draw and fill a rectangular area.</li>
                <li>Circle select: Allows you to draw and fill a circular area.</li>
                <li>Free form select: Allows you to draw and fill weird shapes.<br/>
                    &nbsp You can click and drag to draw a wavy line, or create straight lines by using individual clicks.</li>
            </ul>
            In addition to these, you have two modifiers that alter the behavior of your selected fill mode.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733169517508821022/Screenshot_65.png"
                 alt="Image of fill mode modifiers">
            Neither of these have any affect on single select. However, they modify all other fill modes.<br/>
            The Inverted Selection option will cause you to select every cell that is NOT surrounded by your fill area.<br/>
            The Edges Only option will only select the edges of your defined area. Or, if invertion is also on, will select
            everything but the edges.
        </div>
        <div id="gridcontrols">
            <br/>
            Around the grid there are several additional controls.<br/>
            In the upper left corner is your scaling control.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733172703057674240/Screenshot_66.png"
                 alt="Image of scaling control">
            This allows you to zoom in and out of the grid in order to see more of it at a time.<br/>
            On each side of the grid, there is a small box with three controls.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733173861193089024/Screenshot_69.png"
                 alt="Image of top box with three controls">
            In each box, there is an arrow control. This allows you to move the grid of cells around on your screen.<br/>
            There is a protection to prevent you from moving the entire grid out of view and losing it.<br/>
            Next to the arrow is a plus symbol. Clicking this will add a new row or column of empty cells to that side of the grid.<br/>
            The minus symbol does the opposite, removing the outermost row or column from that side.<br/><br/>
            You can also add and remove rows and columns to the middle of the grid. Select the Single Select fill mode and<br/>
            move your cursor to the edge of the grid. A plus or minus icon will pop up and allow you to add or remove a column or row of cells.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733175253861138462/Screenshot_72.png"
                 alt="Image of internal cell adding icon">
            At the bottom of the editor is a small bar labelled "Show cell counts".
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733178923436867644/Screenshot_76.png"
                 alt="Image of 'Show cell counts' bar">
            Clicking this will open the Cell Counts info bar. This uses an algorithm to count up the number of each
            category of cells are used in your ship.<br/>
            If you are confused by the counts, don't worry. These are more for the developers than you.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733178574961377340/Screenshot_75.png"
                 alt="Image of Cell Counts info bar">
        </div>
        <div id="additional">
            There are several other controls in the upper right corner.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733179175875379270/Screenshot_77.png"
                 alt="Image of additional controls in upper right corner">
            The rightmost control is a button labelled "Center". Clicking this will move your grid so that it is centered on your screen.<br/>
            To the left of this are the undo and redo controls. These are slightly bugged, but you can use these to undo past actions.<br/>
            You can also use the key combinations ctrl+z for undo and ctrl+shift+z for redo.<br/><br/>
            The final control is the "File" button. Clicking this will open the save/open menu.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733180848299442286/Screenshot_78.png"
                 alt="Image of save/open menu in the 'new' section">
            There are four sections to the menu. The first is "new". This will allow you to create a new grid with your desired dimensions.<br/>
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733181554435686450/Screenshot_80.png"
                 alt="Image of save/open menu in the 'open' section">
            The second section is "open". This has two options. The first, labelled "browse" opens your file explorer to import a .shipdesign file.<br/>
            It will also accept .txt and .json files, though these aren't used very much.<br/>
            Under the browse button is a second option labelled "input JSON". This will open a giant text box you can type in.<br/>
            The JSON menu is mostly for development purposes. JSON is a format for storing data as text. The JSON for a light fighter looks like this:<br/>
            <code>[[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,1,1,3],[0,0,0,1,0]]</code>
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733183492120379502/Screenshot_81.png"
                 alt="Image of save/open menu in the 'save project' section">
            The third section, "save project", has a single option. This option downloads a .shipdesign file containing the data for your ship.<br/>
            This allows you to come back to finish your ship later, or share an incomplete design for others to work on.
            <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/486698250183639040/733184340829405184/Screenshot_82.png"
                 alt="Image of save/open menu in the 'save image' section">
            The final section, "save image", will show an image of your design, along with an option to download the image.<br/>
            This is used to submit the finished design to Reddit or Discord.
